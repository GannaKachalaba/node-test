In general to summarize it is that we want to bring Faker back to its basics. 
There are way too many external dependencies at this point. 
Maintaining all locales is work for someone who understands the locale and not the Faker core itself.
Same goes with the images.
To help you guys, it will be very easy extendable so probably you 
just install a custom faker provider that can generate images for you (whatever service it would be).
